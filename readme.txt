This project is to test the Yeoman build with express and experimenting with express. But also mainly to learn more about server side Node.


Project itself:
History:
I love looking at the housing market and (many many years ago) I did a excel sheet fully automated that I just input some number and it tell me if the house was worth buing or not. Why not learn Node while making that online.

This server section will serve specific data for the Font App. Some data might be static, some other data will get fetch from different API aroudn the web. 
Data like: 
- Building type --> Static file.
- Current Interest Rate for Mortgage --> Multiple URL Asycn call.
- Average rent cost per area --> Via Request including passing parameters.

Simple calculation and display will be done on the client side. 

Disclaimer: I get the data from quandl, mistake are possible, if you make decision out of the data, well... We live only once so Go Ahead!
